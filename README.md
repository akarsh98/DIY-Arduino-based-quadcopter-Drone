This is the third and last part of the Arduino based Drone Series. In this project, we will take the Arduino based Flight Controller and The Arduino based Drone Transmitter and Receiver and assemble them together with the Frame to complete our Drone. We will first assemble the Frame of the Drone and after completing the Frame, we will attach motors and ESCs to it. Once that is done, we will calibrate the motors and after calibrating them, we will place the Flight Controller and The Drone Receiver on the Frame and at the end, we will complete the remaining circuitry to get the drone working.

ESC calibration means that we are going to inform our ESC of the max and min limit between which it is going to be operated. The Calibration of ESCs is necessary to prevent some problems such as motors not starting together or the speed of some motors not being as it should have been. These kinds of problems can be prevented by calibrating the ESCs. It is a very simple process and can bedone using an Arduino UNO by uploading a simple code and doing some simple connections.

After we are done with the ESC calibration, we need to Place the Flight Controller and the Drone Receiver on the Frame and do some connections between these two devices. After those connections are done, we can connect the battery and power up the drone. Once the drone is powered up, we need to Arm the drone i.e. we need to turn the drone ON by taking the left joystick of the Transmitter to the bottom right corner. This will turn On the drone and we can test its flight.
